LUDUM DARE 52: Harvest

TODO:
  - revisit using other collider shapes since the impulse hack should probably fix original issue
  - determine what the limiting mechanic is (limited number of ramps at a time? limited total ramp length?)

  - disallow drawing ramps through the player

- moon harvester moves across 2D map; reverses when it hits a wall but capable of climbing ramps up to 45 degrees
- you have the ability to draw walls/ramps (up to 2 at a time) to help the moon harvester traverse obstacles and collect helium nodes
  - ramps are drawn with either LMB or RMB; once you add another ramp of either the LMB or RMB type, the previous one of that type disappears
